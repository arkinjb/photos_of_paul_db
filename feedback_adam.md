## Project Workflow

How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Really like your README, especially your documentation of your
process. Your process in particular seemed very appropriate for this project,
and you executed well, in that your final product is a good MVP.

Your user stories aren't bad, but they should general have a role, goal and a
**reason**. Your wireframe was nice, but your ERD was out of date... I'd suggest
using a tool like lucidchart.com so you can keep your ERDs up to date easily.

## Technical Requirements

How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

**Exceeds expectations**

**Comments**: Overall, your project demonstrates a clear understanding of how
Rails / MVC works, and how to use the framework well... great job!

I liked that you integrated a number of gems (paperclip / AWS / cancancan) in your project.

You also have a many-to-many relationship, which you used well, though see my
suggestion in photo.rb for ideas on how to use has_many :through to make your
code even cleaner!

## Creativity/Interface

How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: I like the idea (it's well-scoped for Project 2, and funny to boot).

The app has a well-designed interface (in terms of pagination and showing
random photos). My only suggestions would be to take some time to adjust padding
and margin in areas like the comments field to improve the design / usability.

## Code Quality

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as
spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your
instructors have in class?

**Exceeds expectations**

**Comments**: Overall, you did a great job here. I honestly don't have a lot to
add, other than the few suggestions I made in the in-line comments.

## Deployment and Functionality

How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

**Exceeds expectations**

**Comments**: All the functionality is clearly exposed, and works as expected,
great job!
